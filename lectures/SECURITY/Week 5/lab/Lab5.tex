\maketitle
Our fifth lab is about hacking into a Windows machine from your Kali Linux. All needed instructions can be found online, so all you need to do is go to \href{https://www.hackthebox.eu}{HackTheBox} and register an account. Click \href{https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/start}{Starting Point} and follow the instructions to hack your way into the box. There are some tricky parts, so feel free to ask in slack if you get stuck.

When you're finished, post a screenshot of the submitted flag including your username.

Good luck!
