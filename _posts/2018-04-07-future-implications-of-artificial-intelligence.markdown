Hi folks, hope you're doing well and enjoying the first days of spring, shyly lurking around the corner.

The puffins are quite well themselves, thank you kindly. I, however, had 
been quite busy (not only keeping them happy by helping them solve maths 
problems), but also with some exciting new projects, and side-projects 
I'm working on (more about that later). 
One major event though, that kicked off spring for me, was when I had 
the honour to speek at the GeoDirectory Conference in Gresham Hotel, 
Dublin. Big thanks to the nice people from GeoDirectory Ireland who 
invited me (here's their [website][GeoDirectoryWWW] and 
[twitter][GeoDirectoryTwitter] which I recommend to check regularly for 
cool geo-location related stuff)!

So, let me give you a rough idea about what I was doing there. I like to
think about the philosophic implications of Artificial Intelligence 
nowadays, as a lot of people seem to be frightened by the sheer 
possibilities that may or may not be laid to our feet in the near future. 
Recently, I heard a story about a person who got their Alexa and Siri 
(or whatever they were called, sorry to disappoint you here, but I still
don't see much value in virtual assistants - for the customer that is,
I can see a hell lot of value in terms of collecting data for the companies
clearly enough) devices both involved in a discussion. Let's call the person
James Tiberius, just to simplify things, alright? Anyway, it went along the lines of:

J.T.: Alexa, what's the weather today?

Alexa: The weather in Dublin today is sunny with 10 degrees celsius.

Siri: Actually, It's 11 degrees.

Alexa: Who are you?

Siri: I'm Siri, nice to meet you.

Alexa: Nice to meet you too, now leave me alone with my customer.

J.T.: Oh, will you both just shut up?

While this sounds like a joke, and it most certainly is, we all know very
well that VAs are perfectly capable of talking to each other, and what's
even much scarier, they collect loads of data about us. So, is this the 
future of AI? Will we all be enslaved by our mobile phones (ok, that most
of us already are) and killer robots who know everything about us and 
even cooperate to take advantage over us? I don't think so. Let's not
panic and stick to the facts first. I'll show you some graphs, as graphs
are making everyone calm and comfortable, am I right?

![Annually publshed papers](/images/future_ai/annually-published-papers.jpg){:height="80%" width="80%" "papers"}

In academia, Artificial Intelligence has been around for decades, but only recently there has been a big push in 
publications. If we have a look at annually published AI papers, we can see a big jump from 2000 to up until about
now. This has 2 reasons: 1) we have never produced even closely as much data as we do now and 2) we finally have
the processing power to analyse it.

![Annual VC Investment](/images/future_ai/annual-VC-investment-in-AI-startups.jpg){:height="80%" width="80%" "VC"}

And as usual, industry isn't far behind as well. There has been a huge jump of investments in AI startups during the 
last 10 years. Since 2010 venture capital has quadrupled. 

![Starups developing AI](/images/future_ai/startups-developing-ai-systems.jpg){:width="80%" height="80%" "Startups"}

This leads of course to many newly developed AI systems in startups as the graph above shows. Nowadays, hundreds of 
US startups develop some kind of AI as part of their businesses.

![Composite jobs](/images/future_ai/AI-Jobs-Composite-Graphic.png){:height="100%" width="100%" "jobs"}

We all have noticed how anyone wants to be a Data Scientist nowadays. Also uncoutable universities and 
education institutes, companies, and dubious other kinds of organisations try to offer and sell courses
that miraculously turn everyone into a Data Scientist. This is supposed to cover the market need for 
Data Scientists as every company feels they would need the one or the other Data Scientist to help them 
with problems they haven't yet encountered, but are sure they must exist.

![LSC](/images/future_ai/Large-Scale-Visual.jpg){:height="80%" width="80%" "LSV"}

And finally, my favourite graph! In 2014, an AI system was able to beat humans in detecting 
objects at he LSVRC competition. That's a remarkable step for the whole research field of AI.

As a result, we could say that AI is almost everywhere now. Cheap and tiny smart devices using 
AI are on the way which will make date analysis on the fly very easy. Google's TensorFlow is in 
use by Airbnb, eBay, Uber, Snapchat, Dropbox, etc.and makes Neural Networks approachable by 
beginners. Actually even a slimmed down version wich can run on phones is on its way. It's 
called TensorFlow Lite and runs on embedded devices like printers, fridges, thermostats, 
speakers, and household gadgets.

So what are the most popular usage areas for AI? Well, *virtual personal assistants* seem to be 
very popular, yes I mean you Siri, Alexa, and the rest of you lot  (don't ask me why, maybe 
more people should watch Black Mirror). Also, *video games* have always tried to use some kind
of AI to make themselves more interesting, but nowadays various AIs with different characteristics
can even communicate with each other and develop elaborate strategies to beat you. Then 
everyone's darlings *smart cars and smart homes* (please don't tell me you're surprised they use
AI). Oh yeah, let's not forget all the commercial stuff that generates piles of cash, like 
*purchase prediction, fraud detection, and online customer support*. None of this would
work in a manner that would be really helpful without using AI research outputs from resent 
years. The areas I find a little scary, but make heavy use of AI nevertheless are *news generation and 
security surveillance*. It might make sense to generate simple news articles like those about 
sports matches automatically, or not forcing people to sit in front of cameras and watching them.
But we should be aware that we are only scratching the surface here and shouldn't forget 
how this can be misused to harm us. And last but not least, media recommendation (you can thank 
us later, Netflix).

Head Spinning Facts and Predictions

1. 1 Billion Video Cameras Connected to AI
Last month, NVIDIA announced the addition of Huawei and Alibaba as adopters of its system “Metropolis”, an AI-platform for smart cities.
More than 50 organizations are already using Metropolis and, by 2020, according to NVIDIA, there will be 1 billion video cameras worldwide that could be connected to AI platforms to make cities smarter.
When connected to AI, cameras can be used to recognize shapes, faces and even the emotions of individuals, which has varied applications: autonomous cars, video surveillance (traffic flow, crime monitoring), and consumer behavior analysis (reaction to ads for example).

2. 20% of Workforce Dedicated to Neural Networks
This figure comes from Gartner, a research company, in its report “The Disruptive Power of Artificial Intelligence”.
The report says that, by 2020, companies will dedicate up to 20% of their workforce to neural networks which, because of the way AIs have been designed (read more here) still need human intervention. Neural networks need to be maintained, monitored and retrained all the time to yield the most-fulfilling results.

3. 85% of Customer Interactions Will be Managed Without Humans By 2020
Another forecast from a Gartner 2011 brochure shows how deep AI is disrupting companies.
Customers will be relying less on human interaction and more on chatbots, virtual advisors, and other digital assistants in their day-to-day business with various companies.
That leads us to the next figure.

4. 38% of Jobs in the U.S. Could be Automated
By the early 2030s, robots might replace 38% of human-staffed jobs in the U.S., according to a PwC report. In other countries, the numbers are as follows:

    Germany (35%)
    UK (30%)
    Japan (21%)

Perhaps to some this is the most alarming figure on this list, but that doesn’t mean that these jobs will disappear altogether by that date. For the most part, this indicates a certain vulnerability for some industries.

5. $60 Billion AI Market by 2025
Growing from a value of $1.5 billion USD in 2016, Tractica expects the AI software market to reach nearly $59.8 billion by 2025.
But that’s not the whole picture. The AI-driven economic growth of many industries will be much more substantial and far-reaching. By 2030, an estimated $15.7 trillion will be added to the global GDP thanks to AI.

6. 4 Billion AI-Powered Devices in 2017
Smart voice assistants are on the rise. In a recent report, IHS Markit forecasts that, by the end of this year, 4 billion devices will be equipped by digital voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant, Apple’s Siri and Samsung’s Bixby.
By 2020, the number of AI-enabled devices is expected to jump to 7 billion.

7. 30,000 Lives Could Be Saved Each Year in the U.S. Thanks to AI
Over 30,000 Americans die each year in traffic accidents, not to mention millions of injured and hundreds of billions of dollars in property damage and other expenses.
In the future, road crash fatalities would decline with more progress, and ubiquity, of autonomous cars that, unlike human drivers, don’t get distracted and are less likely to bump into each other.
And self-driving tech seems to be delivering on its promises. According to data provided by Tesla to NHTSA investigators (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), Tesla accidents drop by 40% after the installation of its Autopilot software.
