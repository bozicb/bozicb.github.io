Hi folks, hope you're doing well and enjoying the first days of spring, shyly lurking around the corner.

The puffins are quite well themselves, thank you kindly. I, however, had 
been quite busy (not only keeping them happy by helping them solve maths 
problems), but also with some exciting new projects, and side-projects 
I'm working on (more about that later). 
One major event though, that kicked off spring for me, was when I had 
the honour to speek at the GeoDirectory Conference in Gresham Hotel, 
Dublin. Big thanks to the nice people from GeoDirectory Ireland who 
invited me (here's their [website][GeoDirectoryWWW] and 
[twitter][GeoDirectoryTwitter] which I recommend to check regularly for 
cool geo-location related stuff)!

So, let me give you a rough idea about what I was doing there. I like to
think about the philosophic implications of Artificial Intelligence 
nowadays, as a lot of people seem to be frightened by the sheer 
possibilities that may or may not be laid to our feet in the near future. 
Recently, I heard a story about a person who got their Alexa and Siri 
(or whatever they were called, sorry to disappoint you here, but I still
don't see much value in virtual assistants - for the customer that is,
I can see a hell lot of value in terms of collecting data for the companies
clearly enough) devices both involved in a discussion. Let's call the person
James Tiberius, just to simplify things, alright? Anyway, it went along the lines of:

J.T.: Alexa, what's the weather today?

Alexa: The weather in Dublin today is sunny with 10 degrees celsius.

Siri: Actually, It's 11 degrees.

Alexa: Who are you?

Siri: I'm Siri, nice to meet you.

Alexa: Nice to meet you too, now leave me alone with my customer.

J.T.: Oh, will you both just shut up?

While this sounds like a joke, and it most certainly is, we all know very
well that VAs are perfectly capable of talking to each other, and what's
even much scarier, they collect loads of data about us. So, is this the 
future of AI? Will we all be enslaved by our mobile phones (ok, that most
of us already are) and killer robots who know everything about us and 
even cooperate to take advantage over us? I don't think so. Let's not
panic and stick to the facts first. I'll show you some graphs, as graphs
are making everyone calm and comfortable, am I right?

In academia, Artificial Intelligence has been around for decades, but only recently there has been a big push in 
publications. If we have a look at annually published AI papers, we can see a big jump from 2000 to up until about
now. This has 2 reasons: 1) we have never produced even closely as much data as we do now and 2) we finally have
the processing power to analyse it.

And as usual, industry isn't far behind as well. There has been a huge jump of investments in AI startups during the 
last 10 years. Since 2010 venture capital has quadrupled.

This leads of course to many newly developed AI systems in startups as the graph above shows. Nowadays, hundreds of 
US startups develop some kind of AI as part of their businesses.

![Composite jobs](/images/future_ai/AI-Jobs-Composite-Graphic.png){:height="100%" width="100%" "jobs"}

We all have noticed how anyone wants to be a Data Scientist nowadays. Also uncoutable universities and 
education institutes, companies, and dubious other kinds of organisations try to offer and sell courses
that miraculously turn everyone into a Data Scientist. This is supposed to cover the market need for 
Data Scientists as every company feels they would need the one or the other Data Scientist to help them 
with problems they haven't yet encountered, but are sure they must exist.

And finally, my favourite graph! In 2014, an AI system was able to beat humans in detecting 
objects at he LSVRC competition. That's a remarkable step for the whole research field of AI.
