In early October, I packed up all my puffins and headed off to sunny 
California for the [17th International Semantic Web Conference][ISWC] held in 
the scenic town Monterey. We were lodged in a park with lots of wildlife 
(which scared the puffins tremendously, but they have to improve their
networking skills anyway). 

A very welcoming and awesomely encouraging fact was that the conference 
was enabling women to get into the spotlights and finally accomplished 
showing recognition to the amazingly huge amount of work and effort
women are putting in especially in the Semantic Web Community. Not very 
surprisingly the conference was a major success, kicking ass of all 
sceptics and misogynists who still think Computer Science is doing fine 
by being overrepresented by men. Therefore: Well done ISWC!

The success can also be derived from the statistics of this year's ISWC:
* Attendees: 438
* Research track had 167 submitted papers, 39 accepted.
* In Use track had 55 sumitted papers, 17 accepted.
* Resources track had 31 submitted papers, 6 accepted.
* Posters and Demos 38 and 39.
* 14 industry presentations.

This shows as well that Semantic Web technologies have a very high level of usability now.

## Semantic Web is now Knowledge Graphs
## Other Emerging Topcs
## What about Machine Learning?
## Workshops and Tutorials
## Interesting Papers
## What are the Conclusions?
