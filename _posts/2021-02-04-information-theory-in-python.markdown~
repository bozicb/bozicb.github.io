It's been a long while since the last post, but also so many things have happened. We have been through a pandemic (well, we're actually still in the middle of it, but at least there seems to be some light on the horizon due to the start of vaccination). Oh, and thanks for asking, the puffins are fine. Actually even better than ever. They seem to be the only people enjoying the lockdown, what can i tell ya ... But for all normal people, including students and lecturers (and don't ya dare tell me we're not normal people now), it's been incredibly hard.

Personally, I found lecturing without being in the same room with students, quite challanging. Don't get me wrong, some things are even better this way, and I'm not talking about students not having to see me as I'm still using my camera (muahaha), but for example recorded lectures are a huge plus for students, as they can rewatch them at their leasure and take more time to take in new stuff.

So things have change, at it mostly affects the use of technology to get the most of our lectures. I hope I will post a few things about the best way (imho) to work on maths problems collaboratively online, but I'm not quite there. Still testing stuff. However, this post is all about how to use code to make math problems more interesting. In particular, I'll be looking into teaching information theory in Python today. You can find all my code, here: [GitHub Information Theory Repo](https://github.com/bozicb/information-theory) It's still in it's baby shoes and growing constantly, but feel free to fork and send me pull requests.
