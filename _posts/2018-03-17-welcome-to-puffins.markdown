Hi folks, welcome to my brand new blog 'Problems with Puffins'!

![I'm a puffin!](/images/puffin.png){:height="10%" width="10%" "Here's one of those cute, little fellas."}

In this blog, I will introduce you to puffins (you might've noticed I love these birds) and numerous problems they 
encounter on their journey through the world of machine learning, natural
language processing, and many other research areas, but also just funny 
and interesting maths problems. In fact, everything that crosses the 
puffins' minds will be covered in this blog, and those brilliant little 
fellas have a lot on their plates. No wonder, they have plenty of time 
for coming up with the wildest of thoughts while hanging out and about on Ireland's beautiful cliffs.

Also the puffins' favourite programming language seems to be Ruby (for 
some reason, guess they just love shiny things, so far they refused to tell me the truth), so I guess we will come across a lot of code like this:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tesla the Puffin')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tesla the Puffin' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out github to see what other problems the puffins and I are 
dealing with: [Github][bozicb-gh].

Thanks for reading, we'll be back soon (have to finish our cucumber sandwiches first)!
