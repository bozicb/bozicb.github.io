Hi everyone and welcome to my brand new blot 'Problems with Puffins'!

![I'm a puffin!]("/images/puffin.png")

In this blog, I will introduce you to puffins and numerous problems they encounter on their journey through the world of machine learning, natural
language processing, and many other research areas, but also just funny and interesting maths problems. In fact everything that crosses the puffins' minds will be covered in this blog, and those brilliant little fellas have a lot on their plates.

Also the puffins' favourite programming language seems to be Ruby (for some reason), so I guess we will come across code like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tesla the Puffin')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tesla the Puffin' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out github to see what other problems the puffins and I are dealing with: [Github][bozicb-gh].

Thanks for reading, we'll be back soon!
