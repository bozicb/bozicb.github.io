Dr. Bojan Božić is a researcher in computer science at Dublin Institute of Technology and has worked on Semantic Web, Machine Learning, and Data 
Science technologies for almost a decade. He was a software engineer in Speech Recognition at Philips Speech Recognition Systems, a Scientist at the 
Austrian Institute of Technology and a Lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences Burgenland and University of Vienna. At AIT's Safety and 
Security department, he worked in leading roles in European research projects such as SANY (Sensor Web Enablement), TaToo (Tagging Tools for 
Semantic Discovery), Europeana Creative (Cultural Inheritage), PELAGIOS (Linked Data), and C2-SENSE (Sensor Web and Interoperability). At Trinity 
College he worked on the ALIGNED project, modelling data and software engineering processes through ontologies and annotations for the Dacura 
platform. He joined CeADAR and the Dublin Institute of Technology to commence research in Data Science and approach innovation and collaboration 
opportunities in new projects.

During his studies he worked full-time at Philips Speech Recognition Systems as Software Developer and Project Manager for 4 years. In March 2009 
he decided to start a career in Research and Science and became part of the Safety and Security department at AIT, where he worked in leading roles 
in European research projects such as SANY (Sensor Web Enablement), TaToo (Tagging Tools for Semantic Discovery), Europeana Creative (Cultural 
Inheritage), PELAGIOS (Linked Data), and C2-SENSE (Sensor Web and Interoperability). In 2015, he decided to join the Trinity College in Dublin and 
work on the ALIGNED project (Semantic Web). His current research field is Semantic Web Technologies, Community Building, and Time Series Processing.
